/**
 * A double-ended queue.
 *
 * A deque can be used either as a queue (First-In-First-Out behavior) or as a
 * stack (Last-In-First-Out behavior).
 *
 * The methods defined by this interface behaves exactely in the same way as
 * the {@link Queue} methods with respect to capacity bounds.
 *
 * The Deque interface inherits from the {@link Queue} interface. Thus, to use
 * a deque as a queue, you can equivalently use the following method set:
 *
 * ||<)(> ''Queue method'' ||<)(>  ''Deque method'' ||
 * || {@link Queue.offer}  || {@link offer_tail}    ||
 * || {@link Queue.peek}   || {@link peek_head}     ||
 * || {@link Queue.poll}   || {@link poll_head}     ||
 * || {@link Queue.drain}  || {@link drain_head}    ||
 *
 * To use a deque as a stack, just use the method set that acts at the head of
 * the deque:
 *
 * ||<)(> ''Operation'' ||<)(>  ''Deque method'' ||
 * || push an element   || {@link offer_head}    ||
 * || peek an element   || {@link peek_head}     ||
 * || pop an element    || {@link poll_head}     ||
